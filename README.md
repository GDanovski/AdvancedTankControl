# AdvancedTankControl
This project contains arduino code for ESP32S tank project and C# code for Windows form application. The connection between the ESP32 and the PC is via Wi-Fi. The tank is moving via 2 H-bridges and has robotic arm controlled via 4 servos. OV7679 camera allows for visual control and the LED light can be switched on and off.

The project is based on the esp-cam-demo by Ivan Grokhotkov (https://github.com/igrr/esp32-cam-demo) and ESP32CameraI2S by 
bitluni's lab (https://github.com/bitluni/ESP32CameraI2S)
